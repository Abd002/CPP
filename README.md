# CPP

## overload functions 

## use dynamic arrays like that 
* when creating 2D or any thing u r dealing with pointer nothing else
~~~
int *arr = new int[5];
/*

*/
delete[] arr;
~~~

## OOP
* if u create static member don't forget to define it in .cpp or it will case linker error
* `int getId() const;` guarantees not to modify the object
